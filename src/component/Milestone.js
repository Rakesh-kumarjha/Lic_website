      <p className='mt-4'>Parekh, who missed out on watching matinee shows and playing cricket during his youth, is now a millionaire who can afford most luxuries of life. As an agent, his annual income is over Rs 4 crore, around five times more than the Rs 87 lakhs that LIC chairman DK Mehrotra took home last year. The sweat and toil behind selling 1,000 odd policies a year, helped Parekh marry his five sisters off in accordance with the demands of Indian tradition.</p><br></br>
      <p>He sells around 1,000 policies a year, the worth of a policy being Rs 2 lakh on an average, and manages to generate a premium of Rs 200 crore for the corporation — the highest generated by any agent in India.</p>

        <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-4">LIC’s Agent Vakalapudi</h1>
        <p className='mt-4'>Every time Venkateswara Rao Vakalapudi thought of an insurance agent, the image that came to his mind was of a pesky person thrusting insurance policies under people’s noses. This was one profession he was certain that he never wanted to pursue. Yet,</p>
        <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-4">ACHIEVEMENT</h1>
        <p className='mt-4'>Today he is Life Insurance Corporation of India’s (LIC) record-breaking star insurance agent.Last year, he earned LIC Rs 51 crore worth of fresh business, an industry record. To put this in perspective, 60 per cent of insurance agents in India do business worth Rs 2 lakh to Rs 3 lakh a year. Vakalapudi, 42, who grew up in a village in West Godavari in Andhra Pradesh, today drives a Range Rover Sport, has a seafacing bungalow at Vizag, has high networth individuals (HNI), nonresident Indians (NRIs) and corporate houses as his clients and travels around the world for business and to give motivational talks.</p><br></br>
        <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-4">Journey</h1>
        <p className='mt-4'> In 1997, his father died. Vakalapudi went into depression, moved back to the village and starting helping his brother with the farm. But he soon shifted to Vizag and started a poultry business. He would collect feed from companies like Hindustan Unilever and Godrej and sell it to farmers for a credit. The going was good. He repaid his debts. But three years later, the farming community found itself in stress. Business plunged. Around his time, some of Vakalapudi’s friends from the engineering college in Hyderabad moved to Vizag. Besides helping them relocate, Vakalapudi introduced them to his insurance agent from whom he had bought a policy for himself and his mother. But the agent was erratic and his friends weren’t satisfied with him.</p>
        <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-4">Journey</h1>
        <p className='mt-4'>Vakalapudi’s approach is different from other agents,” says Raghu. “He first sells himself to the prospective customer before he sells the product.” He listens well, tries to closely follow the customer’s needs, inspires confidence in himself and then offers the policy, says the development officer. It is this unique attitude and approach that has made him successful, Raghu adds.</p>
